#Programming Languages and Frameworks:

Python: The core language used for the project/learning path.
TensorFlow: A popular machine learning library built on Python.
SSH: Secure Shell protocol, likely for remote server access (not strictly Python, but used in development environments).
Machine Learning Areas:

Go Computer Vision: Using the Go programming language (not Python) for computer vision tasks. This might indicate a broader interest in applying different languages.
Machine Learning: The general field of algorithms that learn from data.
NLP (Natural Language Processing): Techniques for computers to understand and manipulate human language.
LLM (Large Language Model): Advanced AI models trained on massive amounts of text data.
